## Goal

Develop a question about real-world human behavior and address it using existing, publicly available data.

## Presentations

During the course of this course, you will give four types of presentations.

1) Slide-based project pitch (2-3 min, 3 slides)

You will give two slide-based project pitches on the second and third course day. The goal of the project pitch is to communicate your project idea and plan. This presentation should consist of three slides. The <b>cover slides</b> features the title, authors, and an image reflecting your topic. Use it to communicate and motivate your question. Tell the audience why it is important to conduct research into your topic and what the target audience stands to gain from addressing your question. The <b>data and method slide</b> features information about your dataset and methodology. Tell the audience how your data and methodology allows you to address your question. The <b>results slide</b> features the sketch of a figure or table of anticipated results that could answer your question in an efficient and direct way.

3) Project pitch (2 min, no slides)

You will give three project pitches at the beginning of each of the three project meetings. These presentations cover the same content of the slide-based project pitches with a focus on motivation, data/methodology, and expected results, but are given without the use of slides.

5) Long final presentation (10 min, 7 slides)

You will give one long presentation in the morning of the final course day. The long final presentation is slide-based and can include up to seven slides. As with other presentations it is key to properly motivate your research question and be concise about methodology and your central results. However, in this presentation you can used additional slides to provide information about the development of your project and discuss limitations, thus allowing for some reflection on your learning journey throughout the course.  

7) Short final presentation (2 min, 2 slides)

You will give one short final presentation during the meet-the-expert event on the final the course day. The short final presentation will likely be very similar to the slide-based project pitches and should include a cover and a figure slide. On the <b>cover slide</b> motivate your topic and research question. On the the <b>figure slide</b> explain your results and discuss their implications for your research question.
